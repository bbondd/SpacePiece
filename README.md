# SpacePiece

input example

vector : [1;2;3]
image path : 'C:\your path\picture.png'
rotate angle : pi/4


vector warning: no Z-axis exception handling. if you want to project in Z-axis, you should enter like [1;1;1000]
when projecting two angles which rotation angle is 0, z value of two vector should not be 0

projecting in x, y, z axis example
first vector : [1;0;0]
first rotate angle : 0

second vector : [0;1;0]
second rotate angle : pi/4

third vector : [1;1;1000]
third rotate angle : 0

All side of pictures should be white.
