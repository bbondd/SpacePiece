Idea

![a](./results/idea.png)

Infer original 3D object via the reversed projection of 2D images
Using Matlab
 



space definition

![a](./results/space_definition.png)




Making an 3D object with maximum 3 projected images
Each images should be projection of target 3D object in random 3 vectors.






Results
